# Pricing Carousel
`Where it says instrumental pricing, let's do a 1x4 grid style instrumental price display, with modern, futuristic, gradient colors. It needs to be eye candy. each section after this should alternate between this eye candy, and a dark minimalist black and white gradient style. For this section, let's make sure you can see all 4 tiles side by side in the frame, rather than having to scroll through them

under the instrumental pricing section, and before the "our services" section I'd like to have a tile that has a title and a body. I'd like this section to have a visual theme of boxes are dark slate with black and white shadow effects.

title: "Your audio is in good hands"

the body:
"When you hire someone to work on a music project, you need them to care as much about the end result as you do. It’s all too common to hear stories of producers drowning out vocals, losing session files or vocal tracks, pushing back timelines, or failing to deliver the desired results.

This is not how I operate. I’m committed to ensuring your session files are backed up on a second hard drive, and that all drafts and mixes are continually updated in a dedicated Google Drive folder as we work on the project. My ultimate goal is to deliver a final copy you’ll be proud to share with the world.

First, we’ll talk and make sure we’re both on the same page about your vision. We can communicate via text, email, or video call, whichever suits you best. Ultimately, my goal is to ensure that we achieve the best possible outcome for your project.

With well over a decade of experience, alongside my vast library of samples and instruments, I’m confident that I can help you take your project to the next level. Click “Examples” to check out what I’ve produced, or fill out the form at the bottom of this page so we can talk about your project!"

In the "our services" section, it should keep each of the 4 descriptive lines in one line, not wrapping into a 5th row. the color should be the eye candy again.

under qualifications and my gear, is a section with 4 parts, titled "Services FAQ & Details"
the sections are instrumentals, producing custom content, mixing and mastering what's the process? and Pricing. It needs to be 4 tiles, with black and white gradient slate. Please ensure all boxes are the same size, and make any wrapping text align with the start of the words after the bullet point, rather than the bullet itself. Here's the content:


Instrumentals – Quality? Edits? Exclusive?
Each beat has a full mix with headroom for the best recording experience
Mp3 – 320Kbps mp3s - Comes as is, no edits by me
Wav – 24 bit 48 kHz – I will do one edit of the song’s structure upon request
Exclusive – Previous clients can still use their copy, no more sales of that beat

Producing Custom Content
This includes but is not limited to producing music/ soundscapes for:
	Podcasts, Spoken Word, Commercials, TV Shows & Movies, 
	Games, Crypto/ NFT Projects, Websites
I will send an upload link if you need to send me your original content
All projects are reviewed, in order to ensure it's a good fit

Mixing & Mastering – What’s the process?
First we’ll have a conversation about your plans with the project
As work progresses, you’ll receive links to draft, mix and master folders
We’ll continually keep in touch to ensure we’re still on the right track
We’re done when you’re happy with the final product

Pricing
All project
Standard pricing is set at a fixed rate, but subject to hourly price 
if more work than expected needs to be done
We use Stripe, PayPal, Venmo, and Crypto (subject to regulations)
Your order may be subject to tax, depending on where you live
Once your project is complete, reviews are greatly appreciated!

email form & create a login section. 

The email form needs to have them fill in first and last name, email, and check a box to help me sort what it's about. the check boxes are each of the services, with one being labeled "Other". There will be a notes section for extra context, at the bottom right of the form, and let's keep it reasonably large

Note before footer:

I look forward to hearing from you!
